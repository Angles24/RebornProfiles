## Blue Mage Leveling & Spell Learning
This is my profile for leveling Blue Mage. It will unlock Blue Mage, level it to 60 doing quests and learning open world spells along the way.

## Setup
Since Blue Mage isn't supported by Magitek I made a very rudementary Kupo routine. It's not great, but it works well enough for leveling.

To get it to work you'll want to make a fresh copy of RB. Do not install Magitek in this fresh copy. For some reason, Magitek tries to take over combat even if you've got Kupo selected as the routine.

In that fresh install of RB, copy the Routines folder into RB's Routine folder. 

It'll look like this:
RB Folder
 |- Routines
      |- Kupo
          |- Rotations
              |- BlueMage.cs


### Known Issues
- [ ] Final Sting, Self Destruct, Acorn Bomb, and 1000 Needles have to be learned manually. The profile will stop at this spot to let you learn them.
- [ ] Sometimes th grind tag doesn't exit when it obtains the level like it's supposed to. Stop and start bot to make it move on.
